# Threat Modeling with Multi-Agent Generative AI - Get help running your threat modeling exercises

![](https://github.com/JeffinWithYa/license-compliance-ai/blob/main/killer_compliance_demo.gif)


This is an open source tool that uses the Autogen multi-agent framework and GPT4 to help working professionals quickly generate data flow diagrams, attack trees, and threat modeling reports from a description of their app architectures.

Features:

- Provide a description of your app architecture, and the tool will generate a data flow diagram using PyTM and Graphviz
- Identify the various components of your app from its description, and understand the vulnerabilities on each component using the STRIDE framework
- Get PDF reports summarizing the STRIDE vulnerabilities on your app's components
- Get PDF reports that include perspectives from technical and non-technical AI stakeholders, representing these roles in a threat modeling exercise
